So, this theme was made using themes.vscode.one

This theme revolves around the colour palettes of 4 girls from the series Oshi No Ko, being:

Ai Hoshino - Foreground, focusBorder, progressBar background, selection background

Ruby Hoshino - acitivityBar foreground, activityBarBadge background, activityBar border, activityBar activeBackground

Akane Kurokawa - List activeSelectionBackground, listFilterWidget background, statusBar background, statusBar noFolderBackground, statusBarItem remoteBackground, menu SelectionBackground, comments

Kana Arima - variables and properties, keywords, numbers, classes and constants, functions and methods, strings, operators and special functions

This is my first theme, so hope you enjoy it.
